  title: Debug It!
  description:
    Professional programmers develop a knack of unerringly 
    zeroing in on the root cause of a bug. They can do that 
    because they have written a lot of buggy code and then gained 
    experience fixing it. This book captures all this experience 
    use it, and you will find you write fewer bugs, and the ones 
    you do write will become easier to hunt down.
